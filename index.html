        <p class="story"> Growing up, my father would oftentimes take me to his garage to ususally tune of his truck or be involved in building such as bed frames or shelves for our home. He taught me a lot and has inspired me to be passionate about the composition of vehicles. I recall watching from afar seeing how he would always be busy and after I grew older, I had the opportuntiies to work alongside him. </p>
