            Chronologically, you will start at elementary, head over to junior high school and complete high school to thus lead you access to the open world. If you are
            like most students, you will find yourself determining whether you would rather go to community college, a 4 year institution or work. Before you consdier this,
            high school should be a place where you learn about yourself, develop goals, and beocme inovled to build your resume. It is suggested that you join clubs,
            college prepratory programs and much more. Be invovled and have fun!

            Afterwards, you must decide whether you want to complete an associate degree, bachelor degree or masters because their time to study for defers and it also depends
            which major accepts them. For example, an engineer would want to complete a bachelor's degree.

            Moreover, you may also want to look into scholarships too as a senior to help with financial aid and apply to FAFSA

            When you look into colleges, you may want to know about where the locations of UC's and Cal States are to see whether or not this campus is suitable for you.

            One example is UCI which is located in Irvine, California. It is relatively known for its nursuing program and if you seem to major in the medical field, this is for you.
            UCI is close to the city so finding an intership is always avaliable to you.

            In my case, I want to be a mechanical engineer becaue I want to work alongside technology and solve existing problems. the campus that suits me is UC Berkeley or UCLA for its
            outstanding engineering programs and intership opportunities. Also, it is in state. I would be able to tackle pollution and deforestation if I were to utilize my knowledge enabliing me to
            make a difference.
