    <h1>Autobiography</h1>
    <h2> Welcome to my page!</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Daniel Barragan.

        I grew up in Anaheim my entire life, but I was born in Santa Ana, California. I identify myself as Latino and growing up with Mexican parents, I learned about my native language, cultural food and customs that are valuable to me.
        Currently, I am a high school senior attending at Anaheim High Schhol and I really enjoy studying mathematics. One of the colleges I would like to attend is UCLA. The reason why I want to study mathematics is because I want to be a mechanical engineer
        to solve problems around our world. I believe I got my inspriation from my grandfather because of his charactersitics and his beliefs.  I live with my mother, father and younger brother whom are significant to my life.
        A fun fact about me is that I am left handed and I love to explore in my free time. One of the places I love to visit is national parks simply because I get to connect with the home that we all grew up with and I feel such
        tranquility.
